# Personal Website

Repository for my personal website

* [andrerfcsantos.dev](https://andrerfcsantos.dev)

## Build the site

The website is made using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator. To build the website into static files, having hugo installed is required. Then the site can be built with:

```bash
cd <project-folder>
hugo
```

This will generate all the website static files in a `public` folder. The contents of this folder then can then be put behind a webserver to serve the site.
